# Wordle-Sync
Synchronises your Wordle save data between your PC and mobile device


## How to use
### Mobile:
For iOS devices, download the shortcut available [here](https://icloud.com)
You may need to enable running shortcut scripts, see [this article](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/shortcuts/apdfeb05586f/5.0/ios/15.0#:~:text=Allow%20scripts%20to%20run%20from%20a%20shortcut)

Once you have installed the shortcut, open wordle **in Safari** and open the `sharesheet` (the thing you use for sending websites to people) and scroll down until you see the `Wordle-Sync` shortcut you installed earlier, run it and allow any required permissions.

Once it is done, you may close the `sharesheet` and you will have access to the Wordle-Sync interface


### PC:
1. Copy contents of the `main.js` file in this repository and go to Wordle
2. Open the developer tools on the Wordle page (`ctrl+shift+I` on most browsers)
3. Go to the `Console` tab (which should already be there) and paste the code you copied earlier
4. Once you press enter, the Wordle page should change into the Wordle-Sync app


### After usage:
You may obtain save data by clicking the button and then copying the data in the save-data box
To load data, you may paste the data into the save-data box and then clicking the coresponding button

You need to refresh the page for changes to apply after loading.
