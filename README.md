# Wordle-Sync
Allows you to transfer your Wordle save data accross different devices
Also allows you to copy data from NYC-Wordle to original Wordle and vice-versa


## How to use
### Mobile:
**Android devices are currently not supported**

For iOS devices, download the shortcut available [here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/dbddf1a6916646cfae953e48efc3c672)
You may need to enable running shortcut scripts, see [this article](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/shortcuts/apdfeb05586f/5.0/ios/15.0#:~:text=Allow%20scripts%20to%20run%20from%20a%20shortcut)

Once you have installed the shortcut, open wordle **in Safari** and open the `sharesheet` (the thing you use for sending websites to people) and scroll down until you see the `Wordle-Sync` shortcut you installed earlier, run it and allow any required permissions.

Once it is done, you may close the `sharesheet` and you will have access to the Wordle-Sync interface


### PC:
1. Open the developer tools Console on the Wordle page (`Shift + Ctrl + J` or `Shift + âŒ˜ + J` on most browsers)
2. Enter the following line of code: 

```javascript
var script = document.createElement("script"); var src = document.createAttribute("src"); src.value = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Bluebotlaboratories/Wordle-Sync@main/main.js"; script.setAttributeNode(src); document.body.append(script);
```

3. Once you press enter, the Wordle page should change into the Wordle-Sync page, at this point you can close the developer tools Console if you want

### PC (Userscript/Tampermonkey):
